    // `data class`: This keyword in Kotlin is used to create a class primarily intended to hold data.
    // It automatically generates useful methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, `copy()`, and component functions.
    // `Success`: This is the name of the data class. It represents a successful outcome of an operation.
    // `<out T>`: This is a generic type parameter.
    //   - `out`: This keyword indicates that `T` is a covariant type parameter. It means that if `A` is a subtype of `B`, then `Success<A>` is a subtype of `Success<B>`. This is useful for read-only scenarios.
    //   - `T`: This is a placeholder for the actual type of data that the `Success` state will hold.
    // `(val data :T)`: This defines the primary constructor of the `Success` data class.
    //   - `val`: This keyword declares an immutable (read-only) property.
    //   - `data`: This is the name of the property. It will hold the actual successful result.
    //   - `:T`: This specifies that the type of the `data` property is `T` (the generic type).
    // `: ResultState<T>()`: This indicates that `Success<T>` is a subclass of `ResultState<T>`. It inherits from the sealed class.
    data class Success<out T>(val data :T): ResultState<T>()
    // `data class Error`: Similar to `Success`, this defines another data class.
    // `Error`: This is the name of the data class. It represents an erroneous outcome of an operation.
    // `<out T>`: This is a generic type parameter, similar to the one in `Success`.
    //   - `out`: Covariant type parameter.
    //   - `T`: Placeholder for the type of the error information.
    // `(val exception:T)`: This defines the primary constructor of the `Error` data class.
    //   - `val`: Immutable property.
    //   - `exception`: This is the name of the property. It will hold the information about the error (e.g., an exception object or an error message).
    //   - `:T`: Specifies the type of the `exception` property is `T`.
    // `: ResultState<T>()`: This indicates that `Error<T>` is a subclass of `ResultState<T>`.
    data class Error <out T>(val exception:T): ResultState<T>()
    // `object`: This keyword in Kotlin is used to declare a singleton object. There will only be one instance of `Loading`.
    // `Loading`: This is the name of the object. It represents a state where an operation is currently in progress.
    // `: ResultState<Nothing>()`: This indicates that `Loading` is a subclass of `ResultState`.
    //   - `Nothing`: This is a special type in Kotlin that has no values. It's used here because the `Loading` state doesn't carry any specific data. It signifies that there's no result *yet*.
